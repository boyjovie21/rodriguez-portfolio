        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

    <p>I am Tricstyll Chyne T. Rodriguez, born on <a href="Activity3.html">20th day of March year 
       of 2007</a>. I am 18 years of age. I am now a first year college student with the degree of 
       Bachelor of Science in Computer Science here in WMSU ESU-IPIL CAMPUS. My mother's maiden name 
       is Anabel T. Rodriguez and my father's name is Patrick H. Rodriguez. I am the eldest child 
       and the only daughter of my parents. I have only 1 sibling, his name is Kharl Patrick T. Rodriguez. </p>
<p>
       In my elementary days, I used to be a consistent Top 1 student in my school. I used to compete with 
       other students in different school. I joined spelling bee contest and poem contest and got the 2nd place 
       among all the students who competes. I also get to meet different kids and somehow I became friends with 
       them. Those experience is one of the most unforgettable moments in my life and sometimes I used to find
       myself reminiscing about it.</p>

 <p>   Growing up, life started to get a bit difficult. The real battle has began the moment I stepped in highschool
       especially now that I am already college. I encounter different problems in my studies. I always doubt myself
       if I can still do it. Life's getting tough as time goes by. Honestly, there are times that I really wanted to 
       give up. The only thing that I always put in mind is that I really need to keep going not just for my self, but
       for the people who believes in me- my family. Everytime I lost my hope, he always remind me to keep going despite
       of all the challenges and struggles in life. I always seek for his guidance and faith to help me at all times. To
       learn to rest but not to quit.</p>
