    <p>My favorite line of this movie is when their father told them that he's<br/>

    </video>
    <p>My favorite part of this movie is when romeo and juliet meet at a party<br/>
    and fall in love, not knowing at first that they belong to rival families. </p>
    
    <h2>Once upon a princess</h2>
         <video width="500" height="300" controls>

             type="video/mp4"/>
         </video>
    <p>This movie portrays that love sometimes requires sacrifice and that choosing<br/>
     what is right is not always easy.</p>


    <h2>Three words to forever</h2>
    <video width="500" height="300" controls>

         </video>

    <p>One of the best lines in the movie is when cristina(kathryn) said there that<br/> 
    "Love is not just about staying together. It's about choosing each other everyday".</p>

    <h2>Miracle in cell no.7</h2>

         </video>


    <p>This movie is a deeply emotional movie because of a man but with a heart of a<br/>
     chidren. Inside the cell, he meets hardened inmates who slowly come to understand his<br/>
     innocence and his love for his daughter. </p>
