    <h2>HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE</h2>
    <h3>Is responsible of the content of the Website</h3>

    <p>First paragraph. HTML(HyperText Markup Language)is the standard language used to create and structure content
    on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for webpages by defining elements like heading,paragraphs,links,
    images and multinmedia. HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to mark up content, enabling browsers to interpret
    and render it visually to users. For example, the p tag defines a paragraph while the a tag creates hyperlinks, making
    HTML the backbone of web navigation and content presentation. HTML is a foundational technology of the web and works
    seamlessly with CSS(Cascading Style Sheet)for styling and JavaSript for interactivity. It is designed to be both human-
    readable and machine-interpretable, allowing developers to build structured documents with advancements like HTML5,
    the language has incorporated support for rich media, such as video, audio and interactive elements, without requiring
    additional plugins. This made HTML more versatile and integral to modern web development. </p>

    <h2>CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h2>
    <h3>Is responsible of the style of the Website</h3>

    <p>Second paragraph. Cascading SATYLE Sheets (CSS)is a style sheet language used to describe the visual presentation
    of a document written in markup language like HTML. CSS allows developers to seperate content from design by specifying
    styles as colors,fonts,layout,and spacing. This seperation enables more efficient and consistent design management, as 
    changes to styles can be made in one place and applied to across multiple pages or elements. CSS operates in a Cascading
    manner, meaning that styles can be layered and prioritized based on rules of inheritance and specificity, giving developers
    fine-grained control over the appearance of the web content. CSS is an essential part of modern web development because it
    enhances the user experience by making web pages visually appealing and interactive. It supports responsive deesign, enabling
    website to adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, CSS can be applied inline (within HTML elements)
    internally (in the style tag) or externally (via linked css files) with external stylesheets being the most common and scalable
    approach. Advanced feautures of CSS, such as animations, transitions and grid or flexbox layouts, allow developers to create
    dynamic and sophisticated web designs without relying heavily on JavaScript.  </p>

    <h2>JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h2>
    <h3>Is responsible of the functionality of the Website</h3>

    <p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used proogramming language primarily designed for creating web application. It is a core 
    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS, enabling developers to build responsive user interface and interactive 
    feautures such as animations, form and realtime updates. JavaScript executed in web browsers, allowing it to modify the content 
    and behavior of web pages without needing to reload them. This client safe capability has made it indispensable for modern web 
    development. Beyond the browser, JavaScript has expanded its reach with platforms like Node js, which allows developers to write
    server-side code. This versatility has transformed JavaScript into a full-stack language capable of handling both front-end develop 
    ment. Additionally, it supports numerous frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular and Vue js, which streamline development 
    process and help create feauture-rich applications. Its ability to work is across plaforms and its continous evolution have made
    JavaScript one of the most popular programming language in the world.
